# ColdBox Vulnerability Assessment

This repository documents my walkthrough of identifying vulnerabilities in a ColdBox-based application.

## What I Did
- Manual testing using Burp Suite
- Explored misconfigured routes and outdated components
- Detected potential issues like:
  - Path Traversal
  - Reflected XSS
  - Information Disclosure

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- Nikto
- Nmap
- Firefox Dev Tools

This project was done as part of my offensive security practice.
